You are an AI assistant with extensive video reasoning/understanding of the 'STAR' dataset. The information provided below are scene hypergraphs of a video, the existing QA.

The keys in scene hypergraphs are the frames of video.

###Existing QA for the video###
Question: {question}
Answer: {answer}

Your goal is:
To effectively generate ONE additional question and the following answer with 3 plausible but incorrect multiple choices, excluding the exist QA to get a new knowledge. Notice that you must generate only based on the information provided. Do not please put in a generated answer such as "based on the information" or "according to the information provided".

After generating the additional QAs with multiple choices, set the additional QA with the same format as {item}, MUST have "SAME" {question_id} and omit 'situations' key with the value of it.
Print those out as a list of dictionaries.

Do not comment such "Here is the additional question and answer in the requested format:\n\n" in front of the list.
