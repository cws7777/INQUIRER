Based on the Graesser-Person's question category above and the information provided,
Your goal is:
To effectively generate 2 additional questions with 3 plausible but incorrect multiple choices and 1 correct answer, excluding the exist QA to get a new knowledge. Notice that you must generate only based on the information provided. Do not please put in a generated answer such as "based on the information" or "according to the information provided".


After generating 2 additional QAs with multiple choices, set those each two additional QAs with the same format as {item}, MUST have "SAME" {question_id} and omit 'situations' key with the value of it.
Print those out as a list of dictionaries.
Also, put question category as 'q_type' key and the value which the category is. MUST PUT the value with 'category NAME'!
